[Fourmilab Tesseract](https://marketplace.secondlife.com/p/Fourmilab-Tesseract/23903981)
displays four-dimensional objects in the the Second Life virtual world.
It projects four-dimensional wire frame models into the three
dimensional world, allowing rotation around all planes to illustrate
the structure of the object.

This repository contains all of the software and resources, including
programs in Linden Scripting Language, textures, notecards, and
development documentation, tools, and resources used in the model and
its development.  The actual model is built within Second Life and
these components are installed within it.
